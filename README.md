# AARP

##Accessible ARP Ready Poison

 This tool makes it easy to perform man in the middle attacks by poisoning the ARP tables of a gatewat and client machine. It makes use of the Scapy library to craft and send packets. 
 
### Differences between versions:

 AARP uses newer versions of command line web tools to display ARP table information, for instance, instead of using 'arp -a' it uses the 'neigh near' command.  
 AARP_Old uses legacy network terminal commands.
